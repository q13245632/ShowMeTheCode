In China, the college entrance exam is believed to be the most cruel exam, which will decide a student¡¯s future. Many young people complain about this educational system, they yearn for the western education, which is reported to be much eaiser. But the fact is that not all foreign students like that.
In America, high school students also need to take the very important exam so as to enter the college. Part of students choose to study in community college or just go to work, so they don¡¯t have much pressure. They enjoy the high school life with joining many activities and taking all kinds of parties. But for the students who want to enter the top university, high school is not easy for them. They need to spend extra hours to study after class, which is much like Chinese students. 
Actually, no matter in which country, every student needs to spend a lot of time studying in order to be competitive. If you yearn for an ease environment in high school, then you¡¯d better prepare for the unexpected future.
